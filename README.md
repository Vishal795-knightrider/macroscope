# MacroScope Performance OS

MacroScope is a multi-platform Performance OS designed to track and optimize human performance across three core systems: **Sleep**, **Nutrition**, and **Activity**. Built with a focus on strict architectural separation and system-driven insights, it provides a unified experience across Web, Desktop, and Mobile.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Unified Performance Tracking**: Monitor Sleep, Nutrition, and Activity in one centralized "Control Center".
- **Signal System**: Replaces traditional "insights" with automated, system-driven alerts that identify how one system affects another (e.g., *"Late meals are reducing sleep consistency"*).
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Cross-platform compatibility using a shared Core logic layer:
  - **Web**: Responsive React application.
  - **Desktop**: Electron-powered desktop experience.
  - **Mobile**: Expo/React Native mobile application.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Vite, React 18, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Real-time Backend**: Powered by Supabase for authentication and data persistence.

## 🏗 Architecture

MacroScope follows a strict layered architecture to ensure platform independence and scalability:

1.  **Core Layer (`/src/core`)**: Contains all platform-agnostic business logic, state management (hooks), and service definitions.
2.  **Platform Layer (`/src/web`, `/src/desktop`, `/src/mobile`)**: UI implementations specific to each platform, consuming the shared Core hooks.

For detailed architecture information, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [React 18](https://reactjs.org/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Desktop**: [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
- **Mobile**: [Expo](https://expo.dev/) / React Native
- **Database/Auth**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

    cd macroscope
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Setup**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Supabase credentials:
